# E-Bike Compare - GitHub Pages Site

This directory contains the built static website for GitHub Pages deployment.

**ðŸš¨ Do not edit files in this directory directly!**

Files in this directory are automatically generated by the build process.
Edit source files in `src/web/` instead.

## How it works

1. Source files are in `src/web/`
2. Build script (`scripts/build.py`) copies them here
3. GitHub Pages serves from this `docs/` directory
4. Crawlers update CSV data files automatically via GitHub Actions

## Local Development

For local development, work directly with files in `src/web/` and use a local web server:

```bash
cd src/web
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit http://localhost:8000
